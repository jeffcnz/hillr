# hillr

A R package for interacting with a Hilltop time series server.

## Getting Started

In R make sure that you have devtools installed.
Remove any preinstalled versions of hillr, then run
devtools::install_github("jeffcnz/hillr")


## Replaces

This package replaces and extends the functions contained in the Hilltop.R repository.  That repository will remain, but this package is meant to be used instead of the previous functions.
